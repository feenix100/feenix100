I am currently a student, working towards a degree in networking and systems administration.
I am trying to break out of this warehouse simulation I am stuck in and get a better job in the tech industry. I could never afford to buy a tesla at my current job.


- 👀 I’m interested in python, javascript, artificial intelligence

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on connecting the human brain to digital computational devices.

```javascript
def calculate_bills_and_paycheck():
    // Prompt the user for the paycheck amount
    try:
        paycheck = float(input("Enter the paycheck amount: $"))
        
        // Calculate the monthly bills as $100 more than each paycheck
        monthly_bills = paycheck + 100
        
        // Display the slowly increasing snowball of debt
        print(f"Paycheck: ${paycheck:.2f}")
        print(f"Bill Payment: ${monthly_bills:.2f}")
        print(f"Debt accumulated every paycheck: ${monthly_bills - paycheck:.2f}")
        
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value for the paycheck amount.")

// Call the function to see how my life is going into debt
calculate_bills_and_paycheck()
```
