# About Me

Iâ€™m currently a student pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. My goal is to escape from the warehouse simulation loop I am stuck in. Then find a more fulfilling job in the tech industry simulation. 

I am an engineer, yet I don't have any problems to solve. I have the freedom to build but Iâ€™m still searching for a purpose that gives direction to that freedom. Thereâ€™s always something I could work on, but rarely something that must be done. 

- ðŸ‘€ **Languages & Technologies**: Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust
