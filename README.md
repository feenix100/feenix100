# About Me

I’m currently a student pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. My goal is to escape from the warehouse simulation loop I am stuck in. Then find a more fulfilling job in the tech industry simulation. 

### Interests
- 👀 **Languages & Technologies**: Python, JavaScript, Java
- 💞️ **Collaboration Goals**: Exploring connections between the human brain and digital computational devices. I want to develop code for brain embedded devices. How can we connect computers to the human brain?
- Your eyeballs could become cameras, imagine taking a picture of your point of view, literally, then sharing that with other people, the same way that your eyes viewed it. We just need the right hardware installed, we can use javascript for everything else...
