**`Tech Developer`**

I am an engineer, yet I don't have any problems to solve. I have the freedom to build but I’m still searching for a purpose that gives direction to that freedom.

I have been building random apps. My skills could be put to better use, if I could find the right opportunity.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Justin's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I have been using computers for 25+ years. There were no companies with entry level tech jobs in my area, so I have been outside looking in. Working in warehouses just to pay the bills by day, coding for free by night, thinking of a better future the whole time. Recently, I became a Computer Science Student. My goal is to escape from the warehouse simulation loop I am stuck in. Then find a new job in the tech industry simulation. I decided to begin a youtube channel to connect with other developers. I have been building in stealth mode for years, I need to get my skills in public view. Watching myself work will give me an insight into how i can improve my processes to become a better tech developer. I generally write random apps, but I enjoy when the software interacts with hardware in the real world. I like writing code that has a visible effect on the physical world...
