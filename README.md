I am currently a student, working towards a degree in networking and systems administration.
I am trying to break out of this warehouse simulation I am stuck in and get a better job in the tech industry. I could never afford to buy a tesla at my current job.


- 👀 I’m interested in python, javascript, artificial intelligence

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on connecting the human brain to digital computational devices.
